## Introduction

**Context**

We apply classical statistical tests to the *Student Mental Health* dataset to identify significant factors influencing depression.

**Tests Covered:**

1.  **One-Sample t-Test:** Is the average student Age significantly different from 20?
   
2.  **Two-Sample t-Test:** Does Age differ between students with and without Depression?
   
3.  **Wilcoxon Test:** A robust comparison of Age vs Anxiety.
 
4.  **Fisher's Exact Test/ Chi-Square:** Is there an association between Gender and Depression?

---

## Data Loading

We load the dataset directly from the repository.
```{webr-r}
# Loading libraries

library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")

# Load Data
url_raw <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohamedkhalilboujdey/Projet_R/main/mental_health.csv.csv"



df <- read.csv(url_raw)

# Data Cleaning
# Remove rows with missing values
df <- na.omit(df)

# Preview
head(df)
head(df[, c("Age", "Gender", "Depression")], 3)
```


---

## 1. One-Sample t-Test

**Question:**  Is the student population significantly different from a typical reference age of 20?

$H_0$: Mean Age = 20

$H_A$: Mean Age $\neq$ 20

```{webr-r}
# One Sample t-test
# We compare the 'Age' column to the theoretical value of 20
t.test(df$Age, mu = 20)
```

---

## 2. Two-Sample t-Test

**Concept:**The two sample t-Test is used to compare the means of two independent groups.
**Application:**Is the mean Age different for students with Depression vs No Depression?

$H_0$: Mean Age (Depressed) = Mean Age (Not Depressed)

$H_A$: Mean Age is different.

```{webr-r}
# Prepare the data vectors
age_depressed <- df$Age[df$Depression == "Yes"]
age_healthy   <- df$Age[df$Depression == "No"]

# Welch Two Sample t-test (default in R)
t.test(age_depressed, age_healthy)
```



---

Classically, one might check if variances are equal before choosing the specific t-test flavor.

```{webr-r}
# F-test to compare variances
var.test(age_depressed, age_healthy)                   
```

If p > 0.05, variances are statistically equal.
```{webr-r}
# t-test assuming equal variance
t.test(age_depressed, age_healthy, var.equal = TRUE)
```

---

**Visualizing the difference:** Create a boxplot to visualize the Age distribution for both groups.

```{webr-r}
boxplot(Age ~ Depression, data = df, 
        main = "Age Distribution by Depression Status", 
        col = c("lightblue", "salmon"),
        ylab = "Age", xlab = "Depression")
```

---

## 3. Wilcoxon Test (Non-parametric)

If we suspect the Age distribution is not normal (e.g., skewed by older students), the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U) is safer.
**Question:**Is the distribution of Age different for students with Anxiety?

```{webr-r}
# Extract data for Anxiety groups
age_anxiety_yes <- df$Age[df$Anxiety == "Yes"]
age_anxiety_no  <- df$Age[df$Anxiety == "No"]

# Wilcoxon test
wilcox.test(age_anxiety_yes, age_anxiety_no)
```

---

## 4. Categorical Association (Chi-Square)

**Question:** Is there a significant association between Gender and Depression?

$H_0$: Gender and Depression are independent.

$H_A$: Gender and Depression are associated.

We use a Contingency Table:

```{webr-r}
# Create contingency table
table_gender_dep <- table(df$Gender, df$Depression)
print(table_gender_dep)
```


---

**Fisher's Exact Test & Chi-Square**

For smaller sample sizes, Fisher's test is more precise. For general purposes, Chi-square is used.

```{webr-r}
# Fisher's Exact Test
fisher.test(table_gender_dep)
```

```{webr-r}
# Chi-squared Test
chisq.test(table_gender_dep)
```

## Project: Anxiety Analysis

**Task:** Perform a complete analysis on the Anxiety factor.

1. Visualize the relationship between CGPA and Anxiety.

2. Test if Marital Status is associated with Anxiety.

Think about which test is appropriate (Categorical vs Categorical).

---

### Project Solution: CGPA vs Anxiety

Since both variables are categorical (CGPA is ranges, Anxiety is Yes/No), we use a bar plot and a Chi-square test.

```{webr-r}
# 1. Visualization
ggplot(df, aes(x = CGPA, fill = Anxiety)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(y = "Proportion", title = "Anxiety Prevalence by CGPA")
```

---

### Project Solution: Marital Status vs Anxiety

```{webr-r}
# 2. Statistical Test
table_marital_anx <- table(df$Marital_status, df$Anxiety)
print(table_marital_anx)

# We use Fisher's test because some counts (e.g., married students) might be low
fisher.test(table_marital_anx)
```

 If p < 0.05, there is a significant association between marital status and anxiety.


---

## Summary of Findings

```{webr-r}
# Rapid Summary Statistics
cat("Dataset Size:", nrow(df), "students\n")
cat("Depression Rate:", round(mean(df$Depression == "Yes") * 100, 1), "%\n")
cat("Anxiety Rate:", round(mean(df$Anxiety == "Yes") * 100, 1), "%\n")
```

### Conclusion:

By using t-tests for continuous variables (Age) and Chi-square/Fisher tests for categorical variables (Gender, Marital Status), we can statistically determine risk factors in the student population.
